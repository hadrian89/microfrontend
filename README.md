# Micro Frontend Architecture Demo with React

Welcome to the Micro Frontend Architecture with React.js repository! 

## Project Structure

In this repository, you'll find the code examples and demonstrations discussed in the blog article. The article explores the core principles and techniques of micro frontend architecture using React.js, including Module Federation, asynchronous loading, error handling with SafeComponent, and sharing functions and states between micro frontends.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    

2. Navigate into the home page application and start the server:
    ```bash
    cd home-app
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

3. Navigate into the products page application and start the server:
    ```bash
    cd header-app
    npm install
    npm start
    ```


The home application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`, the header application should now be running at `http://localhost:3001`.
